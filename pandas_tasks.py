### A few of the fundamental routines for selecting, sorting, adding and aggregating data in DataFrames

Difficulty: *easy*

Note: remember to import numpy using:
```python
import numpy as np

Consider the following Python dictionary `data` and Python list `labels`:

``` python
data = {'animal': ['cat', 'cat', 'snake', 'dog', 'dog', 'cat', 'snake', 'cat', 'dog', 'dog'],
        'age': [2.5, 3, 0.5, np.nan, 5, 2, 4.5, np.nan, 7, 3],
        'visits': [1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1],
        'priority': ['yes', 'yes', 'no', 'yes', 'no', 'no', 'no', 'yes', 'no', 'no']}

labels = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']

Previous exercises have seen us analysing data from DataFrames equipped with a single index level. However, pandas also gives you the possibilty of indexing your data using *multiple* levels. This is very much like adding new dimensions to a Series or a DataFrame. For example, a Series is 1D, but by using a MultiIndex with 2 levels we gain of much the same functionality as a 2D DataFrame.

"""## Plotting

### Visualize trends and patterns in data

Difficulty: *medium*

To really get a good understanding of the data contained in your DataFrame, it is often essential to create plots: if you're lucky, trends and anomalies will jump right out at you. This functionality is baked into pandas and the puzzles below explore some of what's possible with the library.

**56.** Pandas is highly integrated with the plotting library matplotlib, and makes plotting DataFrames very user-friendly! Plotting in a notebook environment usually makes use of the following boilerplate:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
plt.style.use('ggplot')
```

matplotlib is the plotting library which pandas' plotting functionality is built upon, and it is usually aliased to ```plt```.

```%matplotlib inline``` tells the notebook to show plots inline, instead of creating them in a separate window.  

```plt.style.use('ggplot')``` is a style theme that most people find agreeable, based upon the styling of R's ggplot package.

For starters, make a scatter plot of this random data, but use black X's instead of the default markers. 

```df = pd.DataFrame({"xs":[1,5,2,8,1], "ys":[4,2,1,9,6]})```

Consult the [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html) if you get stuck!
